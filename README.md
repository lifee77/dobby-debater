# Dobby Debater

Dobby Debater is an interactive AI-powered debate bot built using the Dobby API. This project aims to create a bold and unfiltered conversational AI capable of debating philosophical, societal, or personal topics with users.

## Features

- Dynamic debate topics (philosophy, technology, ethics, etc.)
- Blunt and witty responses
- Adjustable tone and difficulty
- Real-time interactive UI

## How It Works

1. The user selects a topic or inputs their own.
2. Dobby generates an argument based on the chosen topic.
3. The user responds, and Dobby continues the debate in real time.

## Technologies Used
